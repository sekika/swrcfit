## Migration to unsatfit
From January 4, 2022, development of the GNU Octave version of SWRC Fit was migrated to a Python library [unsatfit](https://sekika.github.io/unsatfit/). Unsatfit also performs fitting of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function. The [web version of SWRC Fit](http://purl.org/net/swrc/) uses unsatfit as a library and performs fitting of water retention function only, and is still called SWRC Fit. The source code of the new SWRC Fit is [published with unsatfit](https://github.com/sekika/unsatfit/tree/main/swrcfit).

The source code of the GNU Octave version is available at this GitHub repository, but It is no longer used, developed or maintained by the author.
